# MQTT

Notes...

### Test Setup A: Server + x Rooms a 5 people + 

* Test random join & leave and message receiving
* Authorize Functionalitty in 


- Benchmark for Ampq
  - Scaling Amqp it self
   -> Rabbitmq or ZeroMq
- Mqtt
 - if we know that we can handl e x (ex. 20.000)

- 20.000 concurrent connections (simulating chat rooms)
  ->
  People: 
    - Andy Piper

  Chat:

  Feed:

  RabbitMq
  Redis
  Mosca
  Mosquitto
  ZeroMq

## Things to test
-> Rountrip time for all message of a room (6 people)


-> Feed simulation: 10k,20k connected clients total time to propagate one message to everyone
  -> total time
  -> avg time


-> ZeroMq backend

Test: Check the with Rabittmq + Mqtt setup throughput
->ZeroMq: Throughput 60k-70k
